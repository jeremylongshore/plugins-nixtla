# Nixtla Workspaces & Labs

This is the top-level playground and lab layer for the Nixtla plugin showcase. Each workspace is a self-contained area for a specific Nixtla domain (TimeGPT, StatsForecast, MLForecast, NeuralForecast, HierarchicalForecast). Unlike `005-plugins/` and `003-skills/` which hold shipping artifacts, `002-workspaces/` is where we design, prototype, and validate workflows before packaging them for production or external distribution.

## How workspaces relate to plugins & skills-pack

- **005-plugins/**: Shipping artifacts (MCP servers, cloud functions, deployable plugins). These are production-ready code that external users can install and run.
- **003-skills/**: Shared SKILL bundle for external projects. These are stable, well-documented Claude Skills that can be installed via `nixtla-skills init`.
- **002-workspaces/**: Internal labs where prototypes, scripts, and SKILLs are developed and validated before packaging. This is the "research and development" layer.

**Promotion flow**:
1. Develop and test in `002-workspaces/<lab>/skills/` or `002-workspaces/<lab>/scripts/`
2. When stable, promote to:
   - `003-skills/.claude/skills/` (for reusable SKILLs)
   - `005-plugins/` (for deployable MCP servers or cloud functions)
3. Update marketplace metadata and release

## Who uses workspaces

- **CEO / Leadership**: Quick mental model of all 5 Nixtla domains in one place. Visual tree shows breadth of capabilities.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Wiring CI smoke tests, environment bootstrap scripts, per-domain validation. Each lab has consistent structure for automation.
- **Nixtla Engineers**: Domain "home base" for daily work. TimeGPT engineers work in `timegpt-lab/`, StatsForecast engineers in `statsforecast-lab/`, etc.

## Getting Started

Each workspace has its own README explaining:
- Purpose and scope of that domain
- How to set up the environment (API keys, dependencies)
- Example workflows and scripts
- How to promote work from the lab to production

Start by reading the workspace README for your domain of interest.

## Standards

All workspaces follow the same structure and standards defined in `.directory-standards.md`. This ensures consistency across all 5 labs and makes it easy to onboard new engineers or add new domains in the future.
